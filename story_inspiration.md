# Story Inspiration

The main project in this course is the development of an Interactive Adventure Game.  A requirement for the interactive adventure game is that the player must be able to make choices about how they progress through the story world.

Step 1 for creating an adventure game is to begin crafting an interesting story and story world.  Below are some links that may provide some inspiration.
