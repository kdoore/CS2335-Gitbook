#Inventory Items

#Introductory Ideas
To introduce the topic of working with inventory-type items, we'll start with a simple UI-Button that allows a user to select an item to be added to the inventory system.

Types of inventory items we might imagine collecting and using in a game:
Objects, Spells, Weapons.

Other type of data that might be generated and used to determine gameplay:  
question-answer data - generated by the user making a choice, selection.
