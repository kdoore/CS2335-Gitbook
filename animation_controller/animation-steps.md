#2D Animation Steps

To create a 2D animated character, first you need to find a set of sprites that show a character with slight changes in body position.

After downloading the sprite set, determine which animation states your character will use.  In this case, we'll implement 4 animation states:  `idle, walk, jump, dead`

    - **Import sprites **associated with desired animation states into your Unity project.  Put these in a folder: Sprites/PlayerSprites

    - Select ( shift - to select multiple sprites ) 
    - Drag the set of sprites into the Scene view, you will be prompted to SaveAs,  'Create a new animation'
