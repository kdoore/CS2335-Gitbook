###GameController gameActive To Control Behavior of AppleTree and Basket.

The final step of the project is to make sure we don't have the AppleTree or Basket moving before the game has started, and we also don't want any objects dropping if the game hasn't started.  We have previously defined a bool variable:  gameActive in GameController.cs.  Now we need to add code to the Basket and AppleTree classes so we can using that variable to control movement of these objects.
