Mechanics - a "mechanic", something that connects players' actions with the purpose of the game and its main challenges.[Defining Game Mechanics - Michael Sicart GameStudies.org ](http://gamestudies.org/0802/articles/sicart)

For the most simple type of 2D game, we'll focus on simple 2D game mechanics:

1.  A **Player** gameObject that can be **controlled by the user** to **interact** with other objects in the game-world.

    1.  User-Input: Input-Events control movement
    2.  Interaction:  Collision-Events modify: Score, Health, Collected Items, etc.
