#Overview

Games: “A game is a voluntary interactive activity, in which one or more players follow rules that constrain their behavior, enacting an artificial conflict that ends in a quantifiable outcome.”  [Eric Zimmerman]

A system that encourages learning through strong feedback mechanisms is a game. [ Daniel Cook](http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html)

The Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics Framework for design of game:

Mechanics - a "mechanic", something that connects players' actions with the purpose of the game and its main challenges.[Defining Game Mechanics - Michael Sicart GameStudies.org ](http://gamestudies.org/0802/articles/sicart)

What are Game Mechanics? [http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html](http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/10/what-are-game-mechanics.html)

For the most simple type of 2D game, we'll focus on simple 2D game mechanics, and UI display to provide feedback to the player:

1.  A **Player** gameObject that can be **controlled by the user** to **interact** with other objects in the game-world.

    1.  User-Input: Input-Events control movement
    2.  Interaction:  Collision-Events modify: Score, Health, Collected Items, etc.
