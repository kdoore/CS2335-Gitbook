# Simple Spawner

In the code below, we will spawn a prefab gameObject that's added in the inspector, using the public GameObject variable.  
The prefab gameObjects should have an instance of the PickUp Script added as a script component.

###Objects to Spawn - PickUp Prefabs
PickUp Prefabs to be Spawned in the MiniGame should have the following configuration:  [See PickUp PreFabs](/pickup_items.md)

	- GameObject should be a PreFab
	- A SpriteRenderer Component
	- At least 1 Collider2D component with IsTrigger set to true \(can have additional nested Collider2D components if necessary\)
	- A PickUp script component, with the public attributes like: value, type set in the inspector.
	- GameObject: Tag:  "Collectible" or "Hazard"
	- Can have a Rigidbody2D if the spawned object will be moving
	- Can have an Animator component if the object will be animated
	
	**Important:** The PickUp Prefabs must have a Tag set that corresponds to the PlayerController Tag in OnTriggerEnter2D\( \).  



###Simple Spawner
The code below creates a simple spawner

```java
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class Spawner : MonoBehaviour
{

// The prefab we will spawn
[Header("Set in Inspector")]
public GameObject prefabGood, prefabBad;

// Use this for initialization

private int pauseTime=2;//wait 2 sec before starting
public int numToSpawn=10;
public float chanceToSpawnBad = .10f; //10% chance
public float xRange = 8.0f;
public float yRangeTop = -2.0f;
public float yRangeBottom = -3.5f;
public bool activeSpawning = false;

void Start()
{
	activeSpawning = true; //this will be moved to MiniGameManager so it can start spawning.
	StartSpawning (); //can be called from a Game-controller type class when using a StartGame button.
}

public void StartSpawning()
{
	for (int i = 0; i < numToSpawn; i++)
	{
	Invoke("SpawnPrefab", Random.Range(pauseTime, pauseTime * 2.0f * i)); //more delay for each value of i in the for-loop
	}
}

public void SpawnPrefab()
{
	if( activeSpawning){
		Vector3 position = transform.localPosition;
		position.x = Random.Range(-xRange, xRange);
		position.y = Random.Range(yRangeBottom, yRangeTop);
		float rand = Random.value;
		if (rand < chanceToSpawnBad)
		{
			Instantiate(prefabBad, position, transform.rotation);
		}else{
			Instantiate(prefabGood, position, transform.rotation);
		}
	}
} //end SpawnPrefab method

} // end Spawner
```


###Code Updates:

1.  Updates to: SpawnPrefab( ) method so that all spawned objects become children of the Spawner gameObject in the Hierarchy Panel, this makes the Hierarchy more organized.

2. DestroyAllPickups( ) - finds all objects with PickUp Components that are active in the scene, then destroys their associated gameObject.  This can be executed from the MiniGameManager when the game has ended.

```java
    
    public void SpawnPrefab()
    {
        if (activeSpawning)
        {
            Vector3 position = transform.localPosition;
            position.x = Random.Range(-xRange, xRange);
            position.y = Random.Range(yRangeBottom, yRangeTop);
            float rand = Random.value; //returns value between 0.0 - 1.0 (property)
            GameObject prefab; //variable to hold address of newly spawned gameObject.
            if ( rand < chanceToSpawnBad)
            {    //
                 prefab = Instantiate(badPrefab,position, transform.rotation   );    //instantiate bad
            }
            else  //instantiate good
            {
                 prefab= Instantiate(goodPrefab, position, transform.rotation);
            }
            prefab.transform.SetParent(this.transform); //set Spawner as parent of prefabs in Hierarchy 
        }
    } //end SpawnPrefab

    //Populate an array of all active objects of type: PickUp
    //then destroy the gameObject that has the PickUp component
    public void DestroyAllPickups()
    {
        PickUp[] spawnedPickups = FindObjectsOfType<PickUp>();
        foreach( PickUp item in spawnedPickups)
        {
            Destroy(item.gameObject);
        }
    } //end DestroyAllPickups

```



##Using Random Numbers in Unity

[Unity Manual: Using Random Numbers](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RandomNumbers.html) 

>Choosing a Random Item from an Array - We could refactor Spawner so that it randomly selects elements from an array of prefabs.
Picking an array element at random boils down to choosing a random integer between zero and the arrayâ€™s maximum index value (which is equal to the length of the array minus one). This is easily done using the built-in Random.Range function:-


```
 var element = myArray[Random.Range(0, myArray.Length)];
 
 var element = myList[ Random.Range( 0, myList.Count)];
```



>Note that Random.Range returns a value from a range that includes the first parameter but excludes the second, so using myArray.Length, or myList.Count here gives the correct result.
