### enum

The **enum** keyword is used to declare an enumeration, a distinct type that consists of a set of named constants called the enumerator list.

### Interface

### Inheritance 
In C#, a child class can inherit from a parent / base class.  The syntax uses a colon :  in the class definition to indicate a class, ``MyChildClass`` is inheriting from a ``ParentClass``.  In C#, the same syntax is used to indicate that a class is implementing an Interface.  The convention is that all interface names should begin with the letter `I`.  A child class can only inherit from a single base class.  A C# class can implement any number of interfaces. 

``class MyChildClass: ParentClass {  // class definition code  } ``
