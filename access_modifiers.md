#Access Modifiers

[MSDN C# Programming Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173121.aspx)

Access modifiers control access to class instance variables and class methods. 
The default access for class instance variables (fields) and methods in C# is private, if none is specified as part of a declaration / definition then the access is private.
