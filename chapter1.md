# Unity Game Engine

In this course we'll learn to create programs in the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/)

Unity uses a Component Oriented Architecture, where GameObjects are special Unity Objects that act as containers for specialized behavior components.  There are a large number of unity components that provide an easy method to add physics, rendering, interaction, and other behaviors to any game object.  

###MonoBehaviour Components
We'll create custom script components - by having our custom classes inherit from the Unity class: MonoBehaviour.  A custom class that inherits from MonoBehaviour can be added as a component to a gameObject to create customized behaviors.


###Visual Studio  
In this course, we'll use Microsoft Visual Studio Editor as your IDE.  It can be integrated to work as with the Unity editor.  (Default Unity IDE for Windows OS)
