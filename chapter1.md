# Unity Game Engine

In this course we'll learn to create programs in the [Unity Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/)

Unity uses a Component Oriented Architecture, where GameObjects are special Unity Objects that act as containers for specialized behavior components.  There are a large number of unity components that provide an easy method to add physics, rendering, interaction, and other behaviors to any game object.  

###MonoBehaviour Components
We'll create custom script components - by having our custom classes inherit from the Unity class: MonoBehaviour.  A custom class that inherits from MonoBehaviour can be added as a component to a gameObject to create customized behaviors.

###MonoDevelop
 We will use the MonoDevelopment Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We will use MonoDevelop as an editor and debugger for writing our C# scripts that we want to use in Unity. MonoDevelop is free and open source (FOSS), and it's tightly integrated with Unity.  This will make it easy to make changes to our code, and to test our modifications within Unity.  (Default Unity IDE for Mac / OSX)

###Visual Studio  
Another option is to use the Microsoft Visual Studio Editor as your IDE.  It can also be integrated to work well with the Unity editor.  (Default Unity IDE for Windows OS)
