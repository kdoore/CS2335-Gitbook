1. Recommendation:  Download **Unity Hub**, it allows multiple versions of Unity on a system, provides access to download and install from within the Unity Hub application. 

2. If you will be using CS or ATEC lab computers, it is recommended that you download the same version currently in those labs for your home computer.
  
3. If you will do your demos using CS lab computers, then I recommend you use the version installed on those computers so you will minimize compatibility issues when you do your demo.

4. For Spring 2019, I will be using version **2017.4.18f1 LTS**

5. [Unity Download Archive Link: - Allows you to select older versions to download / install if you don't want to use Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive?_ga=2.71273109.422491543.1 )

###Component Oriented Architecture

Unity uses a Component-Oriented Architecture, where GameObjects are special Unity Objects that act as **a container** for specialized **behavior components**.  There are a large number of unity behavior components that provide an easy method to add physics, rendering, interaction, and other behaviors to any game object.  

###MonoBehaviour Components
We'll create custom script components - by having our custom classes inherit from the Unity class: MonoBehaviour.  A custom class that inherits from MonoBehaviour can be added as a component to a gameObject to create customized behaviors.


###Visual Studio  
In this course, we'll use Microsoft Visual Studio Editor as your IDE.  It can be integrated to work as with the Unity editor.  (Default Unity IDE for Windows OS)
