#Interfaces

Interfaces in C# are similar to base-class inheritance because they provide structured code that is implemented in another class. Interfaces can include both Properties and Methods. For interface methods no implementation code is defined in the interface, only the method signature is specified. Interfaces define a contract that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface.
