# Spawn Prefab GameObjects
In order to dynamically spawn game objects in a scene, we'll need to first create a Prefab of a gameObject.  A prefab is an asset that we can include in any scene, we can consider that it is a preconfigured gameObject, which can include script components as pre-configured components which are instantiated when an instance of a Prefab is instantiated in a scene.
