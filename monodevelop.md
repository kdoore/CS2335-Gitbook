**MonoDevelop - no longer supported by Unity**
If the **MonoDevelop** IDE opens instead of Visual Studio, then download Visual Studio Community Edition and install it, pay attention to the install location folder.  Then, Re-open Unity, in the top menu, select Unity > Preferences > External Tools.  In the External Tools dropdown, select Visual Studio.  If Visual Studio doesn't show up in the drop down options, then browse to the install location to select it.
