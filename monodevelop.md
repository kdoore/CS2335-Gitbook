#MonoDevelop

MonoDevelop an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is installed as part of the Unity 5 installation.  It is an open-source IDE that is integrated to work with the Unity Editor.

To edit a script in MonoDevelop, first create a script component object inside Unity.  Make sure to name the file correctly when creating it in Unity because the script name is used to create the class name of the C# class that is created for each Unity script component.
