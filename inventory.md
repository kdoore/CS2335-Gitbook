###Player Inventory
For the inventory, we're going to create a player that can interact with other gameObjects, as a means to interact with items in their inventory.  

The [Unity Script Reference Manual](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/) provides documentation for how to create game-like behaviors as interactions between GameObjects.
