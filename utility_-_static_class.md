# Utility - Static Class

We can create a static class: Utility, that has static methods we can call from any script without creating an object instance of the class.  We have been using static methods of the GameObject class, such as: GameObject.Find( ). Static methods provide a convenient way to create methods that we'll use across a series of classes, for functionality that is not specific to a single class.  A perfect example of this type of method is that we often want to toggle visibility of a UI-Panel, and we can do this by adding a Canvas Group component to the UI gameObject.
