Project 3 - Step - by - Step Guide

Follow the guidelines below to complete project 3.

1.  Create a new scene, MiniGame, in a copy of Project 2. (You can name your scene anything you want, I'll refer to mine as MiniGame.  
 
2.  Create a state script, MiniGame.cs, which implements the IStateBase interface.  Here is a link to code you can use for that file: [MiniGame code](/minigame_-_view.md)

3.  Follow the steps in Project 2, to configure the canvas, so it uses [screen-space-camera](/screen-space_canvas.md) rendering mode.
