#Button Example

For this basic example, we'll create some Button and Text gameObjects, and we'll have the Button objects change the text.

We'll create one script:  Controller.cs

To create a script file, 
   - right-click in the Unity Project panel (bottom panel)
   - select 'Create C# Script' from the pop-up options
   - when the script icon shows up in the Asset panel, name it 'Controller'
   
To Edit in Visual Studio
   - Double-click the script icon in the Asset Panel
   - Visual Studio should open with the script displayed
   
Check The Filename and the ClassName to make sure they match - otherwise you will get an error when you try to attach the script to a gameObject.
