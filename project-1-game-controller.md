###Project 1 - GameController Class
It's common to have a GameController class to manage the higher level logic of the game, such as keeping track of score, winning and losing, etc.  We'll create a GameController class for this purpose, and we can attach the script to an empty gameObject called GameController.

This class will manage: 
    * Starting the game when the StartButton is pressed
    * Updating the Score and Score Display when items hit the Basket
    * Determining if the game is over and if the player has won or lost the game
    * Displaying / Hiding the GameOver message
    * Showing / Hiding the StartButton
