#Project 2 - Create New Scene and State

This section will provide details for how to create a Scene and corresponding state to add to the starter project for Project 2.  This assumes you have either downloaded the starter code, or the assets folder and imported that into a new Unity 2D project.

###Create New Scene
To create a new scene, right-click in the Unity Project / Assets Panel and select the Create > Scene option.  Name this scene using a descriptive name according to your project's theme.  Next, Add this scene to your project's build settings, following the instructions in the main Project2 page: [Add scene to Build Settings](https://kdoore.gitbooks.io/cs-2335/content/project-2-text-adventure-1.html#option-2-add-scenes-in-build-settings)
