# Events and Actions

We have seen that State Machines provide a simple framework to model complex system such as games and simulations, because the a complex system can be represented using a set of states, events, and transitions. When viewing a system through a State-Machine lens: 'an event is something that happens which affects the system.' [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine#Events)
