#Visual Novel in Unity

Planning the game: 
1.  Identify story's main character and high-level story plot
2.  Identify a minimum of 5 major scenes in the plot
3.  Identify plot-decision points in each scene that will cause transitions to new scenes
4.  Find assets for main scenes - background, etc.
5.  Define introductory narrative or dialog for Scene1 that provides the player with their first decision to change scenes.
