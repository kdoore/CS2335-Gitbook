# Unity Engine - Event Functions

The Unity Engine provides a set of [Event Functions](http://docs.unity3d.com/460/Documentation/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html) which can be used in any custom class that inherits from MonoBehaviour.  The order of execution of these events is specified by the Unity Engine.   The image below shows the main event functions that we can use in our custom scripts.  There are more event functions than those shown in the image below, but these are the most common ones use in custom scripts.  When creating a custom script, MonoDevelop pre-populates our starter code by including basic code for Start() and Update() functions, but it's important to note that there are other event functions that we may want to use in our scripts.
