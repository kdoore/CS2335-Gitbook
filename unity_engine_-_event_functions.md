# Unity Engine - Event Functions

The Unity Engine provides a set of [Event Functions](http://docs.unity3d.com/460/Documentation/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html) which can be used in any custom class that inherits from MonoBehaviour.  The order of execution of these events is specified by the Unity Engine and illustrated in the image below.   The image below shows the main event functions that we can use in our custom scripts.  There are more event functions than those shown in the image below, but these are the most common ones use in custom scripts.  When creating a custom script, MonoDevelop pre-populates our starter code by including basic code for Start() and Update() functions, but it's important to note that there are other event functions that we may want to use in our scripts, see the [Unity Documentation - Event Execution Order](http://docs.unity3d.com/460/Documentation/Manual/ExecutionOrder.html) for more details.  The majority of our custom game logic will likely be contained in the Update() function which is called once per frame.  We'll use FixedUpdate() when we want to create realistic movement of gameObjects because it is called at fixed time intervals, it may be called more than once per frame, if extensive computation being processed in each frame, Update() may execute at delayed or irregular intervals.
