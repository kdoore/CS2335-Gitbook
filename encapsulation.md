#Encapsulation:

Encapsulation

>A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.[3][4]
A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.[5][6]
Some programming language researchers and academics use the first meaning alone or in combination with the second as a distinguishing feature of object-oriented programming, while some programming languages that provide lexical closures view encapsulation as a feature of the language orthogonal to object orientation.

>The second definition is motivated by the fact that in many of the OOP languages hiding of components is not automatic or can be overridden; thus, information hiding is defined as a separate notion by those who prefer the second definition.
