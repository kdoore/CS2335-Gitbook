#Project 1 - Custom Scripts for Script Components

To give our gameObjects the desired behavior, we'll write several custom C# scripts, one for each type of GameObject, and one to control the overall game.  

###Create Script Asset
In the Asset pane of the Project panel, right click and Create > C# Script.  Name the script: Apple.  Repeat to create the following scripts:  AppleTree, Basket, GameController.  All scripts must be capitalized to meet Visual Studio's requirement that all class names must be capitalized.
