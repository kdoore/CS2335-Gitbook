>Objects stored in a Queue<T> are inserted at one end and removed from the other. Queues and stacks are useful when you need temporary storage for information; that is, when you might want to discard an element after retrieving its value. Use Queue<T> if you need to access the information in the same order that it is stored in the collection. Use Stack<T> if you need to access the information in reverse order

A queue operates in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.  A queue is a specialized data structure that supports adding and removing items using this FIFO access methodology.
