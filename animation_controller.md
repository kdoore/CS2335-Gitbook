# Animation Controller
The Unity Animation controller is a visual programming language implementation of a state machine to control coordination of animations which can be attached to gameObjects.

###Animation Clip
In 2D mode, we can create animation clips using sprites.  We can use a series of sprites, where each sprite is in a slightly different position, so that when we show these sprites in a sequential loop, we see animated behavior.  Or, we can use a single sprite, and use the Animation editor to modify some feature of the sprite over time using the dope-sheet or curves editor.

###Create an Animation from a series of sprites
To create an animation, we can select a series of sprites and drag them into the scene window.  We are then prompted to save this animation.  This immediately creates several components: 
1. Animation clip
2. Animation controller
3. Animator component
