# Branching Narrative - Structure
A major project in this course will be the design and construction of a branching narrative game.  There are a wide variety of branching narrative games, such as Create Your Own Adventure, Visual Novel, Game Book, and others.

An early and popluar CYOA series is the Zork series.  Chris Boraski has created a playable html version of Zork, [The Cavern of Doom](http://boraski.com/zork/index.html), so I suggest that you spend some time playing with this adventure story so you can understand what we're trying to create our project.
