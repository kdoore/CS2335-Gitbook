# Branching Narrative - Structure
A major project in this course will be the design and construction of a branching narrative game.  There are a wide variety of media that we can consider as having the structure of a branching narrative game, such as Interactive Fiction, Create Your Own Adventure, Visual Novel, Game Book, and others.

An early and popluar CYOA series is the *Zork series*.  Chris Boraski has created a playable html version of [Zork, The Cavern of Doom](http://boraski.com/zork/index.html). Spend some time playing with this adventure story so you can understand the gist of what we will create our project.

###Storytelling as Modeling:
Chris Crawford, In his book: Interactive Storytelling:

>Interactive storytelling is a form of modeling, and like other media, it is neither necessary nor desirable that it capture reality in its entirety; it should model only those aspects of reality that the author intends to communicate.

 Nick Montfort, in his book:  Twisty Little Passages: An Approach to Interactive Fiction:

###Interactive Fiction

>"The most direct counterpart to interactive fiction in oral and written literature is seen in the riddle....
>By presenting a metaphorical system that the listener or reader must inhabit and figure out in order to fully experience, and in order to answer correctly, the riddle offers its way of thinking and engages its audience ence as no other work of literature does. Interactive fiction is related to the riddle because the interactor, in facing a puzzle-based interactive fiction, is in a situation similar to that of the riddlee." [Nick Montfort]
