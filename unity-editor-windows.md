1.  **Hierarchy Panel** - this panel contains all gameObjects for the currently viewed scene.  Nested objects have parent-child relationship with respect to transforms. Parent-child relationships can be used to access gameObjects in scripts / code. 

2.  **Scene View** - this window allows constructing details of a scene by adding, modifying gameObjects.  When the editor is in play-mode, the Game view becomes active instead of the scene view in the default layout.  You can manually select the Scene-view tab to see edit-mode details of gameObjects.

3.  **Toolbar** - buttons allow movement / scaling / rotation of gameObjects - See links below for **keyboard hot-keys:  
Q - pan, W - move, E - Rotate, R - Scale, T- Rect Tool (resize)**

4.  **Inspector Panel **- provides editable details of components for the gameObject currently selected in the hierarchy, or for selected gameAssets 

5.  **Project Panel** - Displays file-system assets folder where custom folders, scripts, textures, prefabs are stored.  

6.  **Play controls** - Allows starting,pausing, etc of the current Unity Scene.  When in play-mode, scenes may be switched due to game or user events.

7.  **Game View** - Tab - Toggle the GameView tab to see the camera-view of a scene.  This is the view displayed when in play-mode.  It is often helpful to toggle back to Scene-view when in play mode, so see edit-mode version of gameObjects.
