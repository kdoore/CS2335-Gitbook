Unity Editor
============

Sample Code:  The code section below is a very basic
script example that includes the Start() and 
Update() 


```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
public class Example: MonoBehaviour {
       //Use this for initialization
       void Start () {
       }
       //Update is called once per frame
       void Update () {
        } 
}```
