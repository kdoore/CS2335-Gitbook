Unity Editor
============



Most of the code that we write will end up being attached to gameObjects.  

Sample Code:  The code section below is a very basic
script example that includes the MonoBehavior Start() and 
Update() functions. 


```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
public class Example: MonoBehaviour {
       //Use this for initialization
       void Start () {
       }
       //Update is called once per frame
       void Update () {
        } 
}```
