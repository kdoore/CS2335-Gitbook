[Updated Starter Code (Oct 22): Unity Project Zip File](https://utdallas.box.com/s/8txw4flobwetq4fe4zb92itnp2figpce)

I have created examples of most features you'll want to include in your project.  I've added a few more features that we'll discuss in class.  In the project, we create UI panels to act as containers for other UI elements.  The animated images below show how to add various UI elements as required for this project.

The image below shows the behavior of the starter project.  This includes buttons to hide panels, buttons to show panels, and buttons to change scenes.  Also, there's some player data that gets updated each time you change scenes and this is displayed when clicking on the image button in the lower left. When clicked, this panel's visibility is toggled on and off.

 ###2D Image: Texture to Sprite
 
 In this project you'll add images for background images and button images.  To use images in 2D mode in Unity, first create a Textures folder and then drag your images into that folder.  To use an image, select the image in the Textures folder, then in the inspector select: Texture Type = Sprite ( 2D and UI) and then 'apply'.  Now you can use this for any 2D sprite in your project.

 ###Sprite to Button Image
 
 Once you've converted your image from a Texture to a Sprite, then you can use it as a sprite for such things as a UI button.  First you'll create a UI-Button Oject, then you'll select the image-file as the source image for your button.  See animation below.  You may want to clear the text from the Button's Text field.
