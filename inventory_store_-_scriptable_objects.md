# Inventory Store - Scriptable Objects

In the previous section: [Inventory Items: Scriptable Objects](https://kdoore.gitbooks.io/cs-2335/content/inventoryitems_-_scriptableobjects.html#inventoryitems--scriptableobjects), we created a simple InventoryItem class that we can use as an inventory-system asset.  We created the class to inherit from the ScriptableObject class, this creates a special type of Unity class that can be used to create data assets for non-dynamic, configuration type of data such as for creating elements to represent inventory items for use in a game.
