#Player GameObject

### 2D Sprite as Player 
To create a player character, we'll start by dragging an image, that's had it's import texture-type set to *Sprite(2D - UI)* to the Hierarchy Panel to create a 2D-sprite GameObject: *Girl-player* in a new scene.  

Then we need to attach a RigidBody2D component to our Girl-player.  The [Unity Manual](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody2D.html) explains that we need to add a RigidBody2D component so that we can use the Unity Physics Engine to move our Girl-player in the scene.  We'll update the player's RigidBody.velocity each frame in response to the user key-presses. In addition, the Rigidbody component allows us to sense when our player collides with other game objects.

###Canvas Mode:  Screen-Space Camera
Since we are using sprites to create a game in this scene, we'll need to change our camera settings to allow us to also use UI-objects that will be on a Canvas GameObject. Add a UI-Text GameObject to the scene.  If you double click on your text, you'll see that the scaling for the canvas does not match the scaling for the sprites we've used to create the scene.

###Custom Sorting Layers

We need to define sorting layers for our sprites, this will allow us to define layers that vary in Z depth. First we need to select the layer dropdown tab from the top of the inspector panel and then we choose to add new layers.  We select to add new sorting layers, we create a Background and a Foreground sorting layer.  The ordering of the layers in this list defines the ordering of layers in our scene. Then for each GameObject that we assign with *Sorting Layer Background* those objects will be behind the GameObjects that have been assigned to the Foreground Layer.  We can define additional layers, and we can change the layer ordering dynamically using C# scripts.  (We don't do that in this project)
In addition, the Z transform value for an object can also determine visibility.  The Main Camera has a transform position vector of (0,0,-10) by default.  This means that to move objects closer to the camera, can give them a Z transform value that is between 0 and -10.


###RigidBody2D

In the PlayerMove code below, we write code to allow the user to move the player using various input methods. We're using the UnityEngine Input default mappings so we want to provide access to move the player along the horizontal and vertical axis.  We need to use a RigidBody2D  component because it allows us to use UnityEngine physics engine to create realistic character movement.  

[Unity RigidBody Documentation](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html)
 Rigidbodies enable your GameObjects to act under the control of physics. The Rigidbody can receive forces and torque to make your objects move in a realistic way.
[Rigidbody 2D](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody2D.html), the difference that in 2D, objects can only move in the XY plane and can only rotate on an axis perpendicular to that plane.  Remember to set gravity to 0 if you don't want it to impact your objects.

###Colliders

[Collider interactions](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html)  Colliders interact with each other differently depending on how their Rigidbody components are configured. The three important configurations are the Static Collider (ie, no Rigidbody is attached at all), the Rigidbody Collider and the Kinematic Rigidbody Collider.  Collider Components define the shape of an object for the purposes of physical collisions. A collider, which is invisible, need not be the exact same shape as the objectâ€™s mesh and in fact, a rough approximation is often more efficient and indistinguishable in gameplay. A GameObject that has a Collider but no RigidBody component will act like an immovable object that other objects can run into.
   

###Player Move Code:  Attached to the Girl Sprite:

PlayerMove.cs

```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class PlayerMove : MonoBehaviour {
  public float speed = 10;
  private Rigidbody2D rigidBody2D;

  void Awake(){
    rigidBody2D = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
  }

  void FixedUpdate(){
    float xMove = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
    float yMove = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

    float xSpeed = xMove * speed;
    float ySpeed = yMove * speed;
    
    Vector2 newVelocity = new Vector2(xSpeed, ySpeed);
    
    rigidBody2D.velocity = newVelocity;
  }
}
```

###Player Controller Script

Player.cs - This is the starter version of the Player script, modifications will be made to include: testing to see if a "Bug" was the collision trigger.

```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.UI;

public class Player : MonoBehaviour {
    
    private bool carryingStar=false;
	private bool initialized=false;
	public int starScore=0;
	public int numStars;
    private StateManager manager;
	
	
	void Start(){
	    //  UpdateStarText();
	     
	}

    void OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D hit){
        if(hit.CompareTag("Star")){
                carryingStar=true;
                numStars++;
                manager.numStars++;
                Debug.Log ("on trigger " + numStars);
                UpdateStarText();
                Destroy(hit.gameObject);
        }  // add code to test for other collision triggers
    }
    public void initializeObjectRef(){
		if(manager ==null && GameObject.Find ("GameManager") !=null){
		manager=GameObject.Find ("GameManager").GetComponent<StateManager>();
		Debug.Log ("manager numStars " + manager.numStars);
		initialized=true;
		}
    }
    
    public void Update(){
    	if(!initialized){
    	 	initializeObjectRef();
    	}
    }
  
    private void UpdateStarText(){
            string starMessage= "no stars ;-(";
            
            if(carryingStar){
			starMessage = "Carrying " + manager.numStars + " stars ;-)";
            }
           // starText.text= starMessage;
    }
}

###Move Script - For Bug Movement
```
using UnityEngine;

/// <summary>
/// Simply moves the current game object
/// </summary>
public class MoveScript : MonoBehaviour
{
	public float speed;
    private Vector2 direction;
	private Vector2 position;
	private Vector2 movement;
	private Rigidbody2D  rb2D;
	private Vector3 LowerLeft;
	private float curX;
	
	void Start(){  //initialize values in Start to override inspector default values
		speed=20f ;
		direction = new Vector2(-1, 0);
		rb2D=this.GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
		LowerLeft=Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0,0,0));
		UpperRight=Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint (new Vector3(Screen.width, Screen.height, 0));
		
		Debug.Log("lowerLeft.x " + LowerLeft.x);
		Debug.Log ("UpperRight.x" );  //add code to test for collision with right screen edge.
	}
	
	void FixedUpdate()
	{
	    // check current x position of object
		curX= transform.localPosition.x;  //read only property
		if(curX < LowerLeft.x){
		     speed *= -1;
		}   //add code here to test for collision with right screen edge
		
		//can we add code to flip the image sprite direction?
		movement = new Vector2(
				speed * direction.x,
				speed * direction.y
				);
		
	   //if we have hit the wall direction = direction * -1;		
	
		// Apply movement to the rigidbody
		
		rb2D.velocity = movement;
	}
}
```
###GameState.cs
We need to have a C# State class associated with each scene in our adventure. For this scene, we'll dyamically modify the StarText in the gameScene to show how many stars the player is carrying. This state implements IStateBase, so it has to have definitions for StateUpdate() and ShowIt().  This is also where we'll create code to control levels for the game and to provide button logic to leave the scene. 

```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.UI;


public class GameState : IStateBase {

	private  StateManager manager;
	
	private Text starText;
	
	private bool initialized=false;
	
	public GameState( StateManager managerReference){
		this.manager = managerReference;
		
		Debug.Log ("constructor for gameState");
	}
	
	void initializeObjectRefs(){ 
		if(starText ==null && GameObject.Find("starText") !=null){
			starText=GameObject.Find("starText").GetComponent<Text>();
			Debug.Log ("found star text");
			initialized=true;
		}
	}
	
	public void StateUpdate(){
		if(!initialized){  //if it returns false, if it returns true, don't run it again
			initializeObjectRefs();  //returns false when it fails
		}	
	}
	
	public void ShowIt(){
		if(initialized){
			UpdateStarText();
		}
	}
	
	public void UpdateStarText(){
		if(manager.numStars > 0){
			starText.text="Carrying " + manager.numStars + " stars";
		}
		else{
			starText.text="Not carrying stars";
		}
	}
	
}

```
