>**Rule #1: "Be nice to programmers**," ... "Be very, very nice. Because at the end of the day, the programmer is going to be the one getting your feature in that you're really, really hoping will stay in. And they will remember all that currency you built up when you were irritated with them or anything else, **so always treat programmers with the utmost respect.** 


>Romero stressed that game design is not about simply writing a rulebook about how to jump or carry out other actions. Instead, **designers have to "teach people how to play through the process of play".
**
>**Rule: "Start making games" **  "Don't wait to get to college, just start making games. Now, notice there's no adjective there -- **it doesn't have to be a good game.** It could be a terrible game, in fact it can be an abysmal failure."

##Course Overview: Program a simple Adventure-Game.


 [UTD Mercury Article: Choose your adventure: Spring 19:](https://utdmercury.com/choose-your-adventure/ ) 
 
**Learn: C# OOP-Programming, Object-Oriented Design, System-Modeling (game-systems), Programming Patterns, UML Modeling Language, using Unity Game Engine. **

This course aims to enhance your ability to **Communicate Game-Experience Ideas, Concepts** with programmers and others.   This course teaches **Computational Systems and Patterns** used in programming games by taking a deep dive into the fundamental building blocks of the concepts of game-systems.  **Game are Event-Driven Systems**. The art/science of **Designing Computational-Systems** falls within the domain of '**Modeling and Simulation**', which is a core of Computer Science. This course introduces **Computational Languages, Programming Patterns, System-Modeling, and UML**, a Visual Language to convey these concepts.  This course teaches how to program a **Simple Adventure Game**, using **C#** and Unity Game Engine.   

This course aims to teach **Computational Languages** used to create games. These languages include **C# OOP-programming, State-Machines, Programming Patterns, and the 'Unified Modeling Language' (UML)** _which is a visual language._  In this course, 'Computing Languages' are used to design and implement **Game-System Concepts**. Each Student creates a **Branching-Narrative Adventure Game** where **'designed-interactions'** determine the player's path through the game. 
Students build **Finite-State Machines (FSM)**, to control scene-transitions, animate the player-character, etc. Students will learn the **Component Pattern**(used by Unity) and the **Singleton Pattern** for various game-control systems.  Custom GameObject-Behaviors and game-systems (Dialog, Inventory, Animation) and  are programmed using C#. The **Observer Pattern (Publish / Subscribe)** is used when coding custom **Events** for decoupled object-messaging. Code for an **Inventory-system** uses **Abstract, Static Classes and Methods, Virtual,Override Methods, Interfaces, Enums, C# Generics, Data-structures:** `List<T>`, and `Dictionary <TKey,TValue>.
