>**Rule #1: "Be nice to programmers**," ... "Be very, very nice. Because at the end of the day, the programmer is going to be the one getting your feature in that you're really, really hoping will stay in. And they will remember all that currency you built up when you were irritated with them or anything else, **so always treat programmers with the utmost respect.** [Brenda Romero](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-04-09-brenda-romeros-guide-to-becoming-a-game-designer)


>Romero stressed that game design is not about simply writing a rulebook about how to jump or carry out other actions. Instead, **designers have to "teach people how to play through the process of play".
**
>**Rule: "Start making games" **  "Don't wait to get to college, just start making games. Now, notice there's no adjective there -- **it doesn't have to be a good game.** It could be a terrible game, in fact it can be an abysmal failure."



According to Brenda Romero, The #1 Rule that Game Designers must  need to be able to communicate with Programmers if they want their games to be created.  This course aims to teach you the language so you can communicate with Programmers.  This course should be called " How to communicate with Developers, or to become a Developer, this course teaches about systems and patterns used in programming games by taking a deep dive into the fundamental building blocks of the concepts of game-systems.  Game are Systems, Systems are designed by 'Modeling-Systems'....'Modeling-Systems' is a core domain within Computer Science.  There are well-known Programming Patterns and System-Models, and there is a language used to visually convey these concepts, UML.  This course teaches how to program a 'Simple Adventure Game', using C# and the Unity Game Engine.
