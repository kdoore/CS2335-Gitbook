#WHY Learn about Programming for Modeling Systems with C# and Unity?  Read the article below  - 


>**Rule #1: "Be nice to programmers**," ... "Be very, very nice. Because at the end of the day, the programmer is going to be the one getting your feature in that you're really, really hoping will stay in. And they will remember all that currency you built up when you were irritated with them or anything else, **so always treat programmers with the utmost respect.** [Brenda Romero](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-04-09-brenda-romeros-guide-to-becoming-a-game-designer)


>Romero stressed that game design is not about simply writing a rulebook about how to jump or carry out other actions. Instead, **designers have to "teach people how to play through the process of play".
**
>**Rule: "Start making games" **  "Don't wait to get to college, just start making games. Now, notice there's no adjective there -- **it doesn't have to be a good game.** It could be a terrible game, in fact it can be an abysmal failure."


#Program a 'Simple Adventure Game. 
##Learn C# and the Unity Game Engine to learn:  system-modeling (game-systems), programming patterns, UML modeling language. 

This course aims to teach **Computing Languages** used to create games. These languages include **C# OOP-programming, State-Machines, Programming Patterns, and the 'Unified Modeling Language' (UML)** _which is a visual language._  In this course, 'Computing Languages' are used to design and implement **Game-System Concepts**. Each Student creates a **Branching-Narrative Adventure Game** where **'designed-interactions'** determine the player's path through the game. 
Students build **Finite-State Machines (FSM)**, to control scene-transitions, animate the player-character, etc. Students will learn the **Component Pattern**(used by Unity) and the **Singleton Pattern** for various game-control systems.  Custom GameObject-Behaviors and game-systems (Dialog, Inventory, Animation) and  are programmed using C#. The **Observer Pattern (Publish / Subscribe)** is used when coding custom **Events** for decoupled object-messaging. Code for an **Inventory-system** uses **Abstract, Static Classes and Methods, Virtual,Override Methods, Interfaces, Enums, C# Generics, Data-structures:** `List<T>`, and `Dictionary <TKey,TValue>.  

This course will enhance your ability to communicate game-experience ideas, concepts with programmers and others.  This course should be called " How to communicate with Developers, or to become a Developer. This course teaches about systems and patterns used in programming games by taking a deep dive into the fundamental building blocks of the concepts of game-systems.  Game are Systems, Systems are designed by 'Modeling-Systems'. 'Modeling and Simulation' is a core domain within Computer Science.  There are well-known Programming Patterns and System-Models, and there is a language used to visually convey these concepts, UML.  This course teaches how to program a 'Simple Adventure Game', using C# and the Unity Game Engine.
