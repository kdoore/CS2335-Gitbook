# Foreach

[MSDN Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ttw7t8t6.aspx)

"The foreach statement is used to iterate through the collection to get the information that you want", but should not be used to add or remove items from the source collection. "If you need to add or remove items from the source collection, use a for loop."
