#Project 2 - Dialog Package

The link below is to a Unity package file that can be imported as an asset into your project so you can use it to create some simple dialog for your project.

[Link to Unity Package:](https://utdallas.box.com/v/Dialog-Package)

###Import package
To install the package, you can try the dialog on a new 2D project to see if you want to use it in your project, otherwise, I'd strongly recommend saving a backup of your project before importing.  To import into a Unity project, go to Assets > Import Package > Custom Package, then browse to the downloaded package file from the link above.  Select all assets for import.

###Panel Prefabs
This project contains 2 main prefab objects in the Resources folder
