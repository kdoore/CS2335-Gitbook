#Class Code - Examples - Project 3

###Week of March 19-23

The link below is the starter-project code for Project 3.  

[S18 - Animator-Controller MiniGame_v2 - Example Starter Code Project](https://utdallas.box.com/v/miniGameS18-v1)

**IMPORTANT:** I personally purchased the sprite-set used in the starter-project linked above. **You cannot use this character in your game**. It is not a free-art asset. 
You can find a similar version of these sprites at the link below:
